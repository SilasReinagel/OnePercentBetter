# One Percent Better

Project Website Coming Soon at: https://1percentbetter.us

## Introduction

The "Tiny Gains" philosophy posits that minute, consistent improvements compound over time leading to massive benefits. At its core, the idea champions the belief that a 1% improvement daily can result in being 37 times better over the course of a year. While these incremental changes may seem negligible in the short term, they become monumental when viewed over the long haul.

This software project embodies this philosophy by fostering a community dedicated to making that 1% improvement daily. Powered by a Discord Bot, it aids club members in their reflective journey of growth and continuous improvement.

## Features
  - **Daily Reflections:** Club members receive a daily reminder to reflect on their actions and decisions, ensuring that they are oriented towards that 1% growth.

  - **Community Engagement:** Users can share their daily insights, challenges, and successes, fostering a supportive community that collectively strives for growth.

  - **Motivational Quotes and Tips:** Daily motivation and tips to keep members inspired and educated on ways to achieve their 1% improvement.
